## E-wallet

A small financial system that simulates the way users transact in an online payment 
environment (like PayPal). A user would sign up and gain access to a payment solution where they can choose to either deposit & withdraw money from/to their own wallet and be able to transfer money from their wallet to other users within the same system.

### Simple Requirements/Scenarios :
* Ability for a user to sign up 
* User will start with 0 balance in their wallet(s) 
* User can make deposits in their wallet (using a fake simulation where the balance inputted gets added to their account) 
* User can make withdrawals to their predefined bank accounts (simulated) 
* User can have multiple bank accounts.
* User can only have a single wallet.
* User A can send to User B using their email address 
* User can view their previous transactions/withdrawals/deposits.
